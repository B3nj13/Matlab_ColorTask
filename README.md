# Matlab_ColorTask
5 Users are asked to take part in a color task with use of primed words as a way to gain insight into differences between reaction times.
Our experiment is interested in seeing whether semantic priming will affect the reaction time of color-discrimination judgements. Participants will be asked to decide whether two color patches are exactly the same color or two slightly different colors. These judgements will be preceded with a word prime intended to subconsciously bias the participants to expect one color over another (e.g., after being primed with the word “banana” they are more likely to expect the color yellow). Based off prior work, we hypothesize that participants will have a faster reaction time following congruent prime-color pairs (e.g., banana followed by a yellow color-discrimination judgement) than incongruent prime-color pairs (e.g., banana followed by a red color-discrimination judgement). To analyze our data, we will perform a paired-samples t-test between the congruent and incongruent trials to determine whether an individual’s reaction time is higher in the incongruent trials on average.
